## Timeplan
**Day 1 (16/10):** Reconnaissance field-work of the active hydrothermal system of Palaiochori-Spathi Bays. Snorkeling along the coastline to identify the precise measurement and sampling points using GPS. At the end of the day students will make listings of the sampling/measurement spots, and their field observations.

**Day 2-5 (17, 18, 19, 20/10):** Guided by the list of Day 1, measurements of conductivity, temperature, depth, and physicochemical parameters (pH, T, O2, CH4, TDS), will be conducted above hydrothermal vents, with the use of a CTD instrument cluster (to be provided), in the coastal areas of Palaiochori and Spathi Bays. Water samples will be sampled with Niskin bottles to measure TDS, alkalinity, and nutrients with portable equipment. Scuba divers will be guiding the CTD instrument to maintain high accuracy of measurements and sampling above the venting hydrothermal fluids.

**Day 6 (21/10):** Field trip to old mining sites, OR visits of active mines of industrial minerals and rocks (i.e., Bentonite, Perlite) (IMERYS INDUSTRIAL MINERALS GREECE SINGLE MEMBER S.A) for better understanding the genetic relationship between mineral deposits, emerging volcanism and shallow-marine environment.

## Topics of research
1. Examples from the literature of exploitation of mineral resources onto the continental shelf, i.e., a few km offshore in water depths up to 200 m.
2. Similarities and differences in the geological exploration/investigation of new seafloor mineral reserves, and mining, in deep-sea and shallow-water, respectively.
3. Potential mineral resources for shallow-water mining in Milos.
4. Environmental impacts and risks of shallow-water mining, compared to deep-sea mining.

## Preparation
Here is some litterature that yo ushould read through before starting the cruise. A file with pdfs can be found [here](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/732b4996596350707349233f6f7aa1d120230917120326/e961c16e1948745f70fb020d98d101f520230917120348/4ef501?trk=TRN_TDL_01&utm_campaign=TRN_TDL_01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid).
