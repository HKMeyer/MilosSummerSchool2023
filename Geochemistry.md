# Geochemistry project
# The potential of shallow-water, seabed hydrothermal mineral mining, onto the continental shelf. Can seabed mineral mining move closer to shore?

## Timeplan
Day 1 (16/10): Reconnaissance field-work of the active hydrothermal system of Palaiochori-Spathi Bays. Snorkeling along the coastline to identify the precise measurement and sampling points using GPS. At the end of the day students will make listings of the sampling/measurement spots, and their field observations.

Day 2 and Day 3 (17, 18/10): Guided by the list of Day 1, measurements of conductivity, temperature, depth, and physicochemical parameters (pH, T, O2, CH4, TDS), will be conducted above hydrothermal vents, with the use of a CTD instrument cluster (to be provided), in the coastal areas of Palaiochori and Spathi Bays. Water samples will be sampled with Niskin bottles to measure TDS, alkalinity, and nutrients with portable equipment. Scuba divers will be guiding the CTD instrument to maintain high accuracy of measurements and sampling above the venting hydrothermal fluids.

Day 4 and Day5 (19, 20/10): Continuation and completion of field measurements of Days 2 and 3.

Day 6 (21/10): Field trip to old mining sites, OR visits of active mines of industrial minerals and rocks (i.e., Bentonite, Perlite) (IMERYS INDUSTRIAL MINERALS GREECE SINGLE MEMBER S.A) for better understanding the genetic relationship between mineral deposits, emerging volcanism and shallow-marine environment.
