Welcome Areti, Stine and Ole to the (marine) geophysics project !

The objective of this project is to constrain both the environmental characteristics and the dispersal of particles in the water column. We will approach this topic through a mix of observational work (field and laboratory), data analysis, and modeling (analytical and numerical) with the aim of integrating and reconciling marine observations into a coherent theoretical framework.

## Project description

Our project is articulated around three main pillars of the scientific method:

1. Observing
Objective: Investigate current variability, including system's natural “modes”, Variabilities across space and time.
Q: What are the natural forcing (i.e., bottom current) characteristics? 
Steps: Collecting and analyzing ocean bottom current data (e.g., signal and time-series analysis).
Tools: Tilt current meters (TCM). 
2. Experimenting
Objective: Measuring settling rates of hydrothermal material. 
Q: What are the particle characteristics? 
Steps: Collecting particle samples, Grain-size distribution, Particle size / shape / density / settling velocity, seawater density. 
Tools: sieves, tank, camera, refractometer. 

3. Modeling
Objective: Constraining dispersal of particles.
Q: What are the first-order parameters controlling the dispersal of particles?
Steps: Define model hypotheses, Particle motion function (1D, 3D), Randomise model input selection (e.g., bottom current, settling velocity, release height), Produce density map(s), i.e., likelihood of dispersal.
Tools: Matlab (or equivalent).
