# Macrobiology project

Hi all!  
I'm Heidi and I will be leading the Macrobiology side of things. I am from the USA but have been living in Bergen for the past 5 years. 
I did my PhD at UiB where I analyzed ROV visual data to describe the communities on an arctic seamount. I am now working at IMR doing image cataloguing for the MAREANO project. 

For the macro side of the course, we will be doing some ROV surveys and analyzing the visual data collected using an online and free software called BIIGLE. 
This is a cool program that allows for collaboration between users, different types of annotations depending on the research question, and is very user friendly.  

## Preparation
I need you to make a BIIGLE account ASAP as it sometimes takes a few hours for the BIIGLE team to approve the new user, and closer to the course I will make a project and put on some sample images so you can test out annotating on BIIGLE, although if you wish you could always upload some sample images yourself too. You can make a biigle acount [here](https://biigle.de/). Once you get your biigle account all set up and approved, you can join my biigle project for the course [here](https://biigle.de/project-invitations/610b7e9d-8354-4d13-8ecc-ff40a7f9ec7c).

You can read up more on BIIGLE [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00083/full)  and [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7728927#.ZBSUlHbP1PY).
