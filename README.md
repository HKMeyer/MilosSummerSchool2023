## Description of the course
In this course, we want to provide students with direct research experience at the hydrothermal system of Milos (Greece). This hydrothermal system is a shallow analogue to deep sea vents, and an ideal place for students to be trained in systemic hydrothermal investigation. Students with background in marine geophysics, macrobiology, geomicrobiology and geochemistry will work together to achieve a global understanding of the system, allowing them to understand how minerals are formed and how to assess the potential ecological impact of exploiting these resources (see figure below). They will be involved with actively contested questions, empirical observation, cutting-edge technologies, and the sense of excitement that comes from working to answer important questions. By the end of this course, students will have learned the process leading to thorough and rigorous scientific investigation, including result presentation and discussion.

## Introduction meeting
The video of the online introduction meeting (15th of September 2023) can be found [here](https://filesender.sikt.no/?s=download&token=f5e083e4-a4c4-4ef7-bcd8-bad012ceb3dc). The link expires the 7th of October.

## Things to bring with you for the course
Here is a list of things you should remember to take with you. Feel free to share other things on the discord that I may have forgotten!
- Diving equipment: Snorkel, mask, fins, wetsuit. A watch that can go in the water is very useful too.
- Sun screen + sun glasses
- Laptop
- Some cash may be useful. Remember you will have to pay 175 euro as participation to the food costs on your arrival there.
- A camera, ideally that can go under water!
- Earplugs... remember that you are sharing your room!
- Remember that we will be far from any supermarket, and the supermarket on Milos looks like a Bunnpris on Sunday. So if you have your little guilty pleasure snack that you cannot survive without more than a couple of days I advise you to bring it from home!

## Freediving
In order to retrieve samples and data, we will be freediving every day. The area studied will be less than 5 m deep, and while it is not needed to be able to go down (you can send your colleagues), it would still be more enjoyable to have some basics of freediving.  
The main problem one will face when going down to 5 m is equalisation. Ideally you would like to learn to use Frenzel equalisation, which you can by looking at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxdEvyrKatc), or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo07gZR741M). There are also many more tutorials on the net. If you can't do it, no worries, we will work on it on Milos.  
The second important thing is to try to stay longer under water. For this, it is important to learn to breath properly using your diaphragm. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADdqYzcBeLw&start=934). As well, you can learn to better tolerate the high amount of CO2 in your body. To do so, lie on your couch/bed, and after relaxing and taking a nice last big breath in, hold your breath until the first contraction comes. Take one breath, and start again. Repeat 8 times. You can also do the same thing while walking, but be a bit more tolerant: take maybe 5 breaths between each breathold. Don't walk too fast, and try to relax as much as possible.  
  
REMEMBER: NEVER TRAIN IN THE WATER ALONE!

## Timeplan
Here is a provisional time plan:
