The location of the field course is Paleochori Bay, where we will stay from the 14th to the 24th of October. The location is known by most of the teaching team, and several teachers are Greek and have often been on Milos. Students in geochemistry, geophysics, microbiology, macrobiology will work on some research project in the field. The projects do not involve hazardous scientific activities and are supervised by specialised professors. However, a major component of the work will involve freediving, an activity potentially dangerous if poorly supervised and organised. We have therefore written a specific risk assessment (see below). For the rest, the field course does not pose any specific risks to the participants: Transport is done by airplane, boat, bus, and car, participant sleep at a hotel, and eat at a restaurant.

**1. General description of the freediving activity**
In the frame of their research projects, students will have to freedive in order to collect samples and data. Students and teachers will receive a safety seminar on day 1 in order to learn how to react in case of emergency. Note that most of the measures taken for safety in this course are copied from measures for deeper dives in order to guaranty the security of the participants.

**2. Location**
Milos is a warm place, and everyone will be remembered to properly rehydrate themselves. The bay of Paleochori on Milos is typically sheltered but in case of storm the freediving activities will be postponed. For security and simplicity reasons the area of investigation has been constrained to less than 100 m from the coast, and less than 5 m depth. The hydrothermal system is known to produce some hazardous chemicals (e.g., arsenic and mercury), but these are typically not detected in the water column, allowing Paleochori to be a very touristic bay where one can swim and dive. There is no known hazardous life in the area. While there are some fast boats for tourists in the bay, the place where these are used is indicated and far away from the diving area.

**3. Safety divers**
Three members of the teaching team are certified divers educated in response to emergencies:
- Sven Le Moine Bauer is finishing his certification as CMAS apnea instructor.
- Othonas Vlassopoulos is an ANDI certified scubadiving instructor.
- Susanne Bauer is a scubadiving officer (level-5) in France which allows her to implement security measures for diving events. She is also a vessel captain for the French sea rescue organisation (SNSM). 

**4. Equalization issues**
Equalization issues is the main cause for pain/problems while freediving. In general, the ear pain due to pressure will simply prevent the diver to go deeper, without harming him/her. Students from UiB have received training in basic freediving skills at AdO Arena prior to the course, and known not to push if pain is present.

**5. Surface rest intervals and dive limits**
After diving, it is imperative to rest at the surface before performing the next dive (typically twice the time spent under water). To assure enough resting time, students will always be in group of 3, and rotate to dive. 

**6. Breathing techniques**
Proper breathing techniques are key to perform well and comfortably in freediving. Students will be trained daily in breathing techniques, and learn why hyperventilation should in no case be performed while freediving.

**7. Safety equipment**
Students will all have a wetsuit that allows them to float effortlessly at the surface. Furthermore, any diver will be connected to the surface through a lanyard, allowing for being pulled up in case of need. Each group will have an emergency whistle, and several floating devices (buoy, SUP) will be present in the diving area. A bottle of oxygen will be kept on the coast.
 
**8. Recognizing and responding to emergencies**
The most important issue that can happen while freediving is a blackout (BO), i.e. falling unconscious due to the lack of oxygen available to the brain. This is without consequences given that the unconscious person is taken out of the water as fast as possible so that he/she regains consciousness where air is available. However, failure to do so will most likely result in the death of the freediver. While extremely unlikely to happen due to the depth of diving (<5m) and the freediving level of the students (BO happens more often in competitive freedivers pushing their limits), we are taking several measures to guaranty a safe resolution of any BO:
- Everyone will receive safety instructions on day 1 regarding BO procedure.
- There will always be one of the three safety divers in the water or close to the diving place.
- Students will always be in groups of 3 minimum, allowing for quick reaction in case of BO. Each diver will be connected to the surface by a lanyard, allowing for quick retrieval should he/she fall unconscious.
- Each group will have a whistle attached to the lanyard that can be used to call for help. Safety divers will arrive within seconds at the location and be able to provide appropriated first treatment.
- A bottle of oxygen will be kept on the beach in case of need.
- Milos has several medical facilities allowing for rapid supervision by doctors following recovery of the unconscious diver.

**9. Emergency plan**
Should a BO occur, the following plan will be applied:
- The unconscious diver is pulled to the surface with the help of the lanyard. At the same time the whistle is blown to call the attention of the safety diver. 
- Everyone but for the student group of the unconscious diver and the safety diver is requested to leave the water.
- The safety diver applies the official recovery procedure in case of BO.
- If the diver awakes, he/she is taken to shore and wonâ€™t dive again before 2 days. If needed be, pure oxygen will be provided.
- If the diver does not awake, he/she will be taken to shore and receive CPR until awakening or arrival of the ambulance.
