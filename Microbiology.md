Welcome Mia, Susann and Jack to the microbiology projects. You teachers will be me (Sven) and Steffen, with some inputs from Bjarte, and we will likely need some help from the macrobiologists, geophysicians and geochemists. Everyone basically...

## Preparations
There is a little bit of work to do before we get to Milos. Mainly some lecture:
- Read the this [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1060168/full), it will give you an overview of the microbiology of milos. Feel free to look into the references within.
- In case this is a bit fusy for you, get back to the theory of sequencing 16S rRNA: DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data analysis.
- We will use a Nanopore MinION on the field, so it could be nice if you get aquainted with the technology too.

## Project description
For the microbiology part, we will do 2 main things: Investigating the growth of microbial mats in the bay, and assessing the impact of a plume deposit on the benthic communities.

_Investigation of the growth of microbial mats_
The main idea here is to study the growth and dynamics of the sulfur-oxidizing microbial mats in Paleochori bay, and evaluate how much these would be impacted by the mining. To do so we will have two main research axis:
1. First, we want to map and quantify the amount of mats where they grow. Importantly we will try to understand their growth constrains: Is it temperature? Concentration of O2? Concentration of H2S? This will be done through diving, pictures anotation and analysis (with help from the macrobiologists), and geochemical measurements.
2. Second, we want to investigate their resilience and tolerance to physical perturbation. We will destroy some mats, and study their re-growth over few days. Again, we will be taking pictures, but also some samples. We will do some 16S rRNA sequencing on the samples to see if the microbial community changes with growth of the mats. Look at this paper from [Sievert 2007](https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01156.x) suggesting that _Arcobacter_ is key to start the growth of the mats.

_Assessment of the impact of mining plume deposit on microcommunities_
The main idea here is to investigate the changes triggered by a (mining?) plume deposit on the benthic communities. To do so, we will throw a layer of sulfide and sand on top of the sediments. The change in microbiology communities can be then analysed over time. 
We will delimit an area to study, recover it with some extra sediments, take some cores over the next days, and monitor the changes in microbial communities quantitatively and qualitatively (through 16SrRNA sequecing). We will try this on different types of seafloor, and with both sand and sulfuric minerals.

For the theoretical aspect, we will teach you about hydrothermal systems and their microbial ecology, production of sequencing libraries, sequencing, and data analysis including the specificities of compositional data.
