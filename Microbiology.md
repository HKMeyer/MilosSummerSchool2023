Welcome Mia, Susann and Jack to the microbiology projects. You teachers will be me (Sven) and Steffen, with some inputs from Bjarte, and we will likely need some help from the macrobiologists, geophysicians and geochemists. Everyone basically...

## Preparations
There is a little bit of work to do before we get to Milos. Mainly some lecture:
- Read the this [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1060168/full), it will give you an overview of the microbiology of milos. Feel free to look into the references within.
- In case this is a bit fusy for you, get back to the theory of sequencing 16S rRNA: DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data analysis.
- We will use a Nanopore MinION on the field, so it could be nice if you get aquainted with the technology too.

## Project description
Soon to come...
